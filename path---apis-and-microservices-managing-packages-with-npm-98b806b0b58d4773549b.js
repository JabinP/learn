This file lists the package dependencies for your project. Since npm packages are regularly updated, the <code>package.json</code> file allows you to set specific version numbers for each dependency. This ensures that updates to a package don't break your project.<br><br>npm saves packages in a folder named <code>node<em>modules</code>. These packages can be installed in two ways:<br><br><ol><li>globally in a root <code>node</em>modules</code> folder, accessible by all projects.</li><li>locally within a project's own <code>node_modules</code> folder, accessible only to that project.</li></ol><br>Most developers prefer to install packages local to each project to create a separation between the dependencies of different projects.\nWorking on these challenges will involve you writing your code on Glitch on our starter project. After completing each challenge you can copy your public Glitch url (to the homepage of your app) into the challenge screen to test it! Optionally you may choose to write your project on another platform but it must be publicly visible for our testing.<br>Start this project on Glitch using <a href='https://glitch.com/#!/import/github/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-npm'>this link</a> or clone <a href='https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-npm/'>this repository</a> on GitHub! If you use Glitch, remember to save the link to your project somewhere safe!</p>"},allChallengeNode:{edges:[{node:{fields:{slug:"/apis-and-microservices/managing-packages-with-npm/how-to-use-package-json-the-core-of-any-node-js-project-or-npm-package"},title:"How to Use package.json, the Core of Any Node.js Project or npm Package"}},{node:{fields:{slug:"/apis-and-microservices/managing-packages-with-npm/add-a-description-to-your-package-json"},title:"Add a Description to Your package.json"}},{node:{fields:{slug:"/apis-and-microservices/managing-packages-with-npm/add-keywords-to-your-package-json"},title:"Add Keywords to Your package.json"}},{node:{fields:{slug:"/apis-and-microservices/managing-packages-with-npm/add-a-license-to-your-package-json"},title:"Add a License to Your package.json"}},{node:{fields:{slug:"/apis-and-microservices/managing-packages-with-npm/add-a-version-to-your-package-json"},title:"Add a Version to Your package.json"}},{node:{fields:{slug:"/apis-and-microservices/managing-packages-with-npm/expand-your-project-with-external-packages-from-npm"},title:"Expand Your Project with External Packages from npm"}},{node:{fields:{slug:"/apis-and-microservices/managing-packages-with-npm/manage-npm-dependencies-by-understanding-semantic-versioning"},title:"Manage npm Dependencies By Understanding Semantic Versioning"}},{node:{fields:{slug:"/apis-and-microservices/managing-packages-with-npm/use-the-tilde-character-to-always-use-the-latest-patch-version-of-a-dependency"},title:"Use the Tilde-Character to Always Use the Latest Patch Version of a Dependency"}},{node:{fields:{slug:"/apis-and-microservices/managing-packages-with-npm/use-the-caret-character-to-use-the-latest-minor-version-of-a-dependency"},title:"Use the Caret-Character to Use the Latest Minor Version of a Dependency"}},{node:{fields:{slug:"/apis-and-microservices/managing-packages-with-npm/remove-a-package-from-your-dependencies"},title:"Remove a Package from Your Dependencies"}}]}},pathContext:{block:"managing-packages-with-npm",slug:"/apis-and-microservices/managing-packages-with-npm"}}}});
