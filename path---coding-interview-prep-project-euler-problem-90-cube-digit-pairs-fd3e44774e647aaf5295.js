By placing the two cubes side-by-side in different positions we can form a variety of 2-digit numbers.","","For example, the square number 64 could be formed:","","","","","In fact, by carefully choosing the digits on both cubes it is possible to display all of the square numbers below one-hundred: 01, 04, 09, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, and 81.","","For example, one way this can be achieved is by placing {0, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} on one cube and {1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9} on the other cube.","","However, for this problem we shall allow the 6 or 9 to be turned upside-down so that an arrangement like {0, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} and {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7} allows for all nine square numbers to be displayed; otherwise it would be impossible to obtain 09.","","In determining a distinct arrangement we are interested in the digits on each cube, not the order.","","{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} is equivalent to {3, 6, 4, 1, 2, 5}","{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} is distinct from {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9}","","But because we are allowing 6 and 9 to be reversed, the two distinct sets in the last example both represent the extended set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9} for the purpose of forming 2-digit numbers.","","How many distinct arrangements of the two cubes allow for all of the square numbers to be displayed?"],challengeType:5,fields:{slug:"/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-90-cube-digit-pairs",blockName:"Project Euler",tests:[{text:"<code>euler90()</code> should return 1217.",testString:"assert.strictEqual(euler90(), 1217, '<code>euler90()</code> should return 1217.');"}]},required:[],files:{indexhtml:null,indexjs:{key:"indexjs",ext:"js",name:"index",contents:"function euler90() {\n  // Good luck!\n  return true;\n}\n\neuler90();",head:"",tail:""},indexjsx:null}}},pathContext:{challengeMeta:{introPath:"",template:null,required:[],nextChallengePath:"/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-91-right-triangles-with-integer-coordinates",id:"5900f3c61000cf542c50fed9"},slug:"/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-90-cube-digit-pairs"}}}});
