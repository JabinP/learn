For example, the proper divisors of 28 are 1, 2, 4, 7, and 14. As the sum of these divisors is equal to 28, we call it a perfect number.","Interestingly the sum of the proper divisors of 220 is 284 and the sum of the proper divisors of 284 is 220, forming a chain of two numbers. For this reason, 220 and 284 are called an amicable pair.","Perhaps less well known are longer chains. For example, starting with 12496, we form a chain of five numbers:","12496 → 14288 → 15472 → 14536 → 14264 (→ 12496 → ...)","Since this chain returns to its starting point, it is called an amicable chain.","Find the smallest member of the longest amicable chain with no element exceeding one million."],challengeType:5,fields:{slug:"/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-95-amicable-chains",blockName:"Project Euler",tests:[{text:"<code>euler95()</code> should return 14316.",testString:"assert.strictEqual(euler95(), 14316, '<code>euler95()</code> should return 14316.');"}]},required:[],files:{indexhtml:null,indexjs:{key:"indexjs",ext:"js",name:"index",contents:"function euler95() {\n  // Good luck!\n  return true;\n}\n\neuler95();",head:"",tail:""},indexjsx:null}}},pathContext:{challengeMeta:{introPath:"",template:null,required:[],nextChallengePath:"/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-96-su-doku",id:"5900f3cc1000cf542c50fede"},slug:"/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-95-amicable-chains"}}}});
