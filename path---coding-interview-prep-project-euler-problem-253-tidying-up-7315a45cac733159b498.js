He picks up the pieces at random and places them in the correct order. As the caterpillar is built up in this way, it forms distinct segments that gradually merge together. The number of segments starts at zero (no pieces placed), generally increases up to about eleven or twelve, then tends to drop again before finishing at a single segment (all pieces placed).","","For example:","","Piece Placed","Segments So Far121422936434554354……","","Let M be the maximum number of segments encountered during a random tidy-up of the caterpillar.","For a caterpillar of ten pieces, the number of possibilities for each M is","","M","Possibilities1512      2250912      31815264      41418112      5144000      ","","so the most likely value of M is 3 and the average value is 385643⁄113400 = 3.400732, rounded to six decimal places.","","The most likely value of M for a forty-piece caterpillar is 11; but what is the average value of M?","Give your answer rounded to six decimal places."],challengeType:5,fields:{slug:"/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-253-tidying-up",blockName:"Project Euler",tests:[{text:"<code>euler253()</code> should return 11.492847.",testString:"assert.strictEqual(euler253(), 11.492847, '<code>euler253()</code> should return 11.492847.');"}]},required:[],files:{indexhtml:null,indexjs:{key:"indexjs",ext:"js",name:"index",contents:"function euler253() {\n  // Good luck!\n  return true;\n}\n\neuler253();",head:"",tail:""},indexjsx:null}}},pathContext:{challengeMeta:{introPath:"",template:null,required:[],nextChallengePath:"/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-254-sums-of-digit-factorials",id:"5900f4691000cf542c50ff7c"},slug:"/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-253-tidying-up"}}}});
